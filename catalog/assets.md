## Logo

Please don't modify the logo or use it in a confusing way, including suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Task Analytics, or in a way that confuses Task Analytics.

**We ask that you don't**

- Use any logos or similar imagery to represent Task Analytics other than what is found here
- Change the colors on the logo
- Overprint or obstruct any part of the logo
- Add special effects to the logo
- Use old versions or any other marks or logos to represent our brand

### One line logo

The one line version is the official logo of Task Analytics and should be used in most cases. If horizontal space is a huge issue, resort to the [two lines](#two-lines-logo) version.
