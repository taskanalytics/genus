*This is a draft of how to communicate on behalf of Task Analytics*

## Why do we share this?

We believe that bad communication is the root cause for a lot of problems a company or organisation can have. So much starts with being able to communicate effectively across the whole of the company. So, it follows that good communication at least aids in running a healthy team, organisation or company. Part of our aim in providing valuable, actionable and understandable insights simply have to involve helping in communicating well, and thats why we believe that sharing our
own tone of voice helps us take it more seriously and deliver on promise.

## Writing text

These are something in the middle of guidelines and rules. Don't follow all to the point, but use your best judgement as you use it as a checklist of dos and dont dos.

- Define the target audience
- Prefer using simple words over jargon
- Only use buzzwords when you have reason to do so
- Avoid abbreviations that you have not explained properly in your text
- Explain difficult words the first time they are used
- Don‚Äôt assume the reader understands what you consider to be common concepts
- Address the person, not the persona
- Consider who the sender is ‚Äì you or the company
- Always start by stating what you‚Äôre about to say
- Be bold and opinionated
- Be personal and specific
- Don‚Äôt write to sell, write to share
- 5 min reads is a good target

### Article template

- Title
  - Needs a statement
  - Use verbs
  - 7 words-ish
- Subtitle/Preamble
  - Build suspense
- Body
  - 2‚Äì3 paragraphs per heading
  - Avoid one-sentence paragraphs
  - Be careful with adding links ‚Äì if you need to, add in the ending as footnotes
  - Lists = üòç
- Ending
  - Have a conclusion
  - Tailor a call-to-action to the target audience

## Visuals

- No stock photos

- GIFs are good

- Use 1 visual pr 2‚Äì3 minutes read time
