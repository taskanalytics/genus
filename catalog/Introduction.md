# Task Analytics Genus

Welcome to Task Analytics Genus, the Task Analytics design system and brandbook.

```
a class of things which have common characteristics and which can be divided into subordinate kinds.
```

You can use this tool to figure out how you should make something look, feel and behave. This package is a double-deal; It contains a human-readable styleguide with colors, logos, assets, and best practice information. On the flip side it also contains a pack of React components and JavaScript utilities for building web pages and web applications that look and feel like official Task Analytics creations.

* [Genus is open source and hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/taskanalytics/genus)
* Genus is built using Catalog. For more details about how to use, and build with Catalog, check out the [documentation](https://interactivethings.github.io/catalog/)
