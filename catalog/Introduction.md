# Task Analytics Genus

Hi! Welcome to Task Analytics Genus, the guide to everything style for Task Analytics.

You can use this tool to figure out how you should make something look, feel and behave. This package is a double-deal; It contains a human-readable styleguide with colors, logos, assets, and best practice information. On the flip side it also contains a pack of React components and JavaScript utilities for building web pages and web applications that look and feel like official Task Analytics creations.

Genus is built using Catalog. For more details about how to use, and build with Catalog, check out the [documentation](https://interactivethings.github.io/catalog/)
