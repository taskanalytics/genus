```react|span-3
showSource: true
---
<Number size="small" value={2} description={"Types"} />
```
```react|span-3

## Suffix
Since percentages are used widely, they have their own dedicated component. For everything else, theres the `suffix` prop

```react|span-3
showSource: true
---
<Number prefix="+" suffix="â„ƒ" size="large" value={25} description="Degrees" />
```
